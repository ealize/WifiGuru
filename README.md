WifiGuru - though it has a fancy name, it's a toy project and has limited functionality.

The idea is to study the Wifi usage patterns mainly from user's inputs, location and Wifi connects/disconnects
and make an attempt to save some battery by turning off Wifi when not in a usable zone.

Basic ability to detech Wifi connectivity changes and setup a timer for 3Mins and then turn-off wifi.
